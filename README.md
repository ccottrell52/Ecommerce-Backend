# Ecommerce-Backend

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to create a working backend using SQL 
This will allow you to add update and delete information in your stores database so that you can smoothly
run an eccommerce business. After seeding the database all you have to do is use "npm start" and that will begin your server. 
From there you can use insomnia to work through the functions of the database until a frontend is completed.
